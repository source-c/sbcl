# In a typical test run the outputs would resemble as follows.
# Each group of data contains (gen, class, descriptor, wordindex) where:
#  * "gen"        = generation number, or 'S' for static
#  * "class"      = name of an instance or the name of the widetag
#  * "descriptor" = Lisp pointer to the containing object
#  * "wordindex"  = index into that object from the GC's point-of-view.
