;;;; KLUDGE: The primitive objects here may look like self-contained
;;;; definitions, but in general they're not. In particular, if you
;;;; try to add a slot to them, beware of the following:
;;;;   * The GC scavenging code (and for all I know other GC code too)
;;;;     is not automatically generated from these layouts, but instead
;;;;     was hand-written to correspond to them. The offsets are
;;;;     automatically propagated into the GC scavenging code, but the
;;;;     existence of slots, and whether they should be scavenged, is
;;;;     not automatically propagated. Thus e.g. if you add a
;;;;     SIMPLE-FUN-DEBUG-INFO slot holding a tagged object which needs
;;;;     to be GCed, you need to tweak scav_code_header() and
;;;;     verify_space() in gencgc.c, and the corresponding code in gc.c.
;;;;   * The src/runtime/print.c code (used by LDB) is implemented
;;;;     using hand-written lists of slot names, which aren't automatically
;;;;     generated from the code in this file.
;;;;   * Various code (e.g. STATIC-FSET in genesis.lisp) is hard-wired
;;;;     to know the name of the last slot of the object the code works
;;;;     with, and implicitly to know that the last slot is special (being
;;;;     the beginning of an arbitrary-length sequence of bytes following
;;;;     the fixed-layout slots).
