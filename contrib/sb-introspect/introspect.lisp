  "Returns information about the allocation of OBJECT. Primary return value
indicates the general type of allocation: :IMMEDIATE, :HEAP, :STACK,

Possible secondary return value provides additional information about the
allocation.

For :HEAP objects the secondary value is a plist:

  :SPACE
    Indicates the heap segment the object is allocated in.

  :GENERATION
    Is the current generation of the object: 0 for nursery, 6 for pseudo-static
    generation loaded from core. (GENCGC and :SPACE :DYNAMIC only.)

  :LARGE
    Indicates a \"large\" object subject to non-copying
    promotion. (GENCGC and :SPACE :DYNAMIC only.)

  :BOXED
    Indicates that the object is allocated in a boxed region. Unboxed
    allocation is used for eg. specialized arrays after they have survived one
    collection. (GENCGC and :SPACE :DYNAMIC only.)

  :PINNED
    Indicates that the page(s) on which the object resides are kept live due
    to conservative references. Note that object may reside on a pinned page
    even if :PINNED in NIL if the GC has not had the need to mark the the page
    as pinned. (GENCGC and :SPACE :DYNAMIC only.)

  :WRITE-PROTECTED
    Indicates that the page on which the object starts is write-protected,
    which indicates for :BOXED objects that it hasn't been written to since
    the last GC of its generation. (GENCGC and :SPACE :DYNAMIC only.)

  :PAGE
    The index of the page the object resides on. (GENGC and :SPACE :DYNAMIC
    only.)

For :STACK objects secondary value is the thread on whose stack the object is
allocated.

Expected use-cases include introspection to gain insight into allocation and
GC behaviour and restricting memoization to heap-allocated arguments.

Returns OBJECT.

If SIMPLE is true (default is NIL), elides those pointers that are not
notionally part of certain built-in objects, but backpointers to a
conceptual parent: eg. elides the pointer from a SYMBOL to the
corresponding PACKAGE.

If EXT is true (default is T), includes some pointers that are not
actually contained in the object, but found in certain well-known
indirect containers: FDEFINITIONs, EQL specializers, classes, and
thread-local symbol values in other threads fall into this category.

NOTE: calling MAP-ROOT with a THREAD does not currently map over
conservative roots from the thread registers and interrupt contexts.

Experimental: interface subject to change."
